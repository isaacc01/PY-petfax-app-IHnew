# Petfax - A Pet Profile Management Application

Petfax is a mobile application designed to facilitate user interaction with pet profiles and the generation of informative content regarding them. The development of this application involved the utilization of Python in conjunction with Flask, a micro web framework. During this project, I acquired proficiency in structuring, establishing routing protocols, retrieving user-generated content, and seamlessly incorporating a database system within the Flask-based framework. Subsequently, I integrated my application with a Postgres database, employing Flask-SQLAlchemy to establish robust database connectivity.

## Features

- User-friendly mobile application for pet profile management.
- Seamless integration with a Postgres database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
- Ability to create, update, and delete pet profiles.
- Interactive user interface for viewing and interacting with pet profiles.
- Informative content generation regarding pets.
